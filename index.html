                    <ul>
                        At Canada's leading Financial Technology provider I led 5+ cross-functional initiatives to enhance data-driven decision-making and 
                        innovation. With involvement in leading AIP and QIP planning I gained skills in roadmapping in both the short-term (quarterly) 
                        and long-term (3-5 years) viewpoints.
                    </ul>     
                    <ul>
                        My work included working with 10+ product owners to align feature development, facilitating workshops to 
                        identify architectural improvements, and collaborating with legal, compliance, and innovation teams on exploratory partnerships. 
                        I also built the presentation muscle due to opportunities to pitch to the Executive Committee and other senior leadership championing
                         the exploration of Agentic AI, positioning Interac at the forefront of emerging technologies. Beyond the data teams, I led the 
                         exploration and eventual pitch of a mutli-year partnership benefiting all departments from HR to Product.

                        I utilized data to optimize product performance and streamline operations across the organization. I conducted in-depth quantitative 
                        analyses on feature performance, uncovering opportunities to align with user experience priorities and market trends. By implementing
                         data-driven recommendations, I increased feature adoption by 15% and reduced churn by 10%, directly enhancing customer satisfaction
                         and retention.

                        I also spearheaded the pitch and integration of Amazon Q (Business) as a self-serve analytics solution, transforming 
                        the way data insights were accessed across teams. I developed and facilitated hands-on workshops to onboard 700 employees, provided 
                        ongoing troubleshooting support, and successfully reduced manual reporting efforts by 30%, driving efficiency and fostering a 
                        culture of data empowerment organization-wide.

                            A large project being implemented has been the data quality program to address the major points we can intake data from our students, notably the

                            We are able to then track turnout across events, how many events/ type of events students return to, among other metrics. These insights can then be used
